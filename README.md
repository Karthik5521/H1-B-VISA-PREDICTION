# H1-B-VISA-PREDICTION
In our project, we aim to predict the outcome of H-1B visa applications that are filed by many high-skilled foreign nationals every year. We framed the problem as a classification problem and applied Naive Bayes, SVM in order to output a predicted case status of the application.
